Data-Mining-And-Visualization, Course code: 83676.

the repository includes the course project. 
on the project we handled a classification problem.
where we had to estimate a costumer decision based on his data. 
the data is tabular. 
in the project we manipulated the data, pre-processed it, balanced it and more.
then, we trained a model on the training data and classified the test data. 

the reports are in hebrew, where we wrote all our insights and conclusions.
code is also added in ipynb format.
